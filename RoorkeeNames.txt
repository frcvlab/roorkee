James
	 English and Welsh

	 from the Middle English personal name James. Introduced to England by the Normans this is an Old French form of Late Latin Iacomus a variant of Latin Iacobus Greek Iakōbos the New Testament rendering of Hebrew Ya‘aqob (see Jacob). The medieval Latin (Vulgate) Bible distinguished between Old Testament Iacob (which was uninflected) and New Testament Iacobus (with inflections). The latter developed into James in medieval French. The distinction was carried over into the King James Bible of 1611 and Jacob and James remain as separate names in English usage. Most European languages however make no such distinction so that forms such as French Jacques stand for both the Old and the New Testament names. This surname is also very common among African Americans. Compare Jack.

Jamieson
	 Scottish

	 variant of Jamison. It probably originated in the pronunciation of James as Jamis but the Scottish preference for this form of Jamison will have been reinforced by association with Jamie the Scots pet form of James.

	 occupational name for a fuller from Middle English walker Old English wealcere (an agent derivative of wealcan ‘to walk tread’) ‘one who trampled cloth in a bath of lye or kneaded it in order to strengthen it’. This was the regular term for the occupation during the Middle Ages in western and northern England. Compare Fuller and Tucker. As a Scottish surname it has also been used as a translation of Gaelic Mac an Fhucadair ‘son of the fuller’. This surname is also very common among African Americans.

Walkinshaw
	 Scottish

	 habitational name from Walkinshaw in Renfrewshire. The second element of the placename is Scots shaw ‘small wood’; the first element is probably the present participle of wa(u)lk ‘to full (cloth)’ as in the ubiquitous wa(u)lkmill ‘fulling mill’; perhaps therefore ‘wood by a fulling mill’.

Wollaston
	 English (Warwickshire)

	 habitational name from Wollaston (Northamptonshire) Wollaston in Old Swinford (Worcestershire) or Woollaston in Bradley (Staffordshire). The placenames derive from the Old English personal name Wulflāf (genitive Wulflāfes) + Old English tūn ‘farmstead estate’. There may have been some confusion with Woolston.

Woodville
	 of uncertain origin. It looks like it should be from an unrecorded Middle English form of Old English wudu-fīn ‘wood heap wood pile’ possibly therefore for someone who lived at or near a wood pile but no medieval bearers of such a name have been found. The earliest forms of the name in Cheshire appear to be composed of wood + fen possibly the source of Woodsfin (Lane) in Tattenhall (Cheshire) but it is not recorded before the 1911 edition of the Ordnance Survey map. Woodfine may therefore be an altered form of another name such as Woodfall or its variant Woodfield with the common subsitution of /n/ for /l/. Compare Margreta Woodfall 1676 in IGI (Runcorn Cheshire) Mary Woodfall 1678 in IGI (Frodsham Cheshire) and Anne Woodfield 1562 in IGI (Witton cum Twambrooks Cheshire) with the 1566 1587 and 1724 bearers whose names could allude to Woodfall Hall in Preston (Lancs). For the Kent name compare Henry Woodfield 1618 in IGI (Linsted Kent) with the 1594 bearer cited below who may have taken their names from Woodfalls in Yalding (Kent) or perhaps the names are altered forms of Woodville.
